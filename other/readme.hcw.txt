All data are in the file hcw-data.txt, an ASCII file in DOS format that is

The panel data used in this paper consists of 25 countries arranging in the
following order:

(1) Hong Kong
(2) Australia
(3) Austria
(4) Canada
(5) Denmark
(6) Finland
(7) France
(8) Germany
(9) Italy
(10) Japan
(11) Korea
(12) Mexico
(13) Netherlands
(14) New Zealand
(15) Norway
(16) Switzerland
(17) United Kingdom
(18) United States
(19) Singapore
(20) Philippines
(21) Indonesia
(22) Malaysia
(23) Thailand
(24) Taiwan
(25) China

The only variable we used is quarterly real GDP growth rate, which is
constructed by adjusting nominal GDP growth rates by CPI. All the data are
obtained from OECD Statistics, International Financial Statistics and CEIC
Database. There are 61 time series observations for each country.

For the first set of results (Political Integration), quarterly real GDP
growth rates from 1993Q1 to 1997Q2 are used to form the counter-factual path
from 1997Q3 up to 2003Q4. Besides, only 10 countries are used. They are
China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan,
Thailand and US.

For the second analysis (Economic Integration), quarterly real GDP growth
rates of all 24 countries (Country (2) to Country (25)) from 1993Q1 to
2003Q4 are used to form counter-factual from 2004Q1 to 2008Q1.
